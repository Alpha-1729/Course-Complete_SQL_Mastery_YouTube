/*
>>>> Before we go ahead and generate our database tables, we need to make sure that our design is optimal and doesn't allow duplicated data.
>>>> Normalization.
        It is the process of reviewing our design and ensuring that it follows a predefined rules that prevent data duplication.
        There are seven rules or seven normal forms and each rule assumes that you have applied the previous rules.
        For 99% of the application, we only need to apply first 3 normal forms.
