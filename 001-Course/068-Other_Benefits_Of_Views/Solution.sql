-- Other Benefits Of Views
/*
>>>> Benefits of views.
Simplify the queries.
Reduce the impact of changes.
- Suppose you deleted or renamed a column in a table, then you have to change the column name in multiple places. If you are using a view, you only need to change in one place.
Restrict access to the data.
- It can provide an abstraction layer over the tables.
- You can restrict access to some of columns or the table itself.
- And provide a view with limited columns in the actual table.
